  <p class="lh-copy f5">9.	<strong>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</strong>. Most of Your concerns about the Services can be addressed by contacting ID8 at TERMSOFUSE@ASURION.COM. For any dispute with ID8, You agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5 pl4">A. <strong>YOU AND ID8 AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF THROUGH COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION</strong>. YOU AND ID8 AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY. YOU AND ID8 AGREE TO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDINGS. This Arbitration Agreement ("ARB") shall survive the termination of the Agreement and is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. This ARB shall be interpreted broadly, and it includes any dispute You have with ID8 that arises out of or relates in any way to Your relationship with ID8 or the Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or otherwise. However, this ARB does not preclude You from bringing an individual action against ID8 in small claims court or from informing any federal, state or local agencies of Your dispute. Such agencies may be able to seek relief on Your behalf.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5 pl4">B. To initiate arbitration, send a written Notice of Claim by certified mail to: Legal Department, P.O. Box 110656, Nashville, TN 37122-0656. The Notice must describe the dispute and the relief sought. If ID8 does not resolve the dispute within 60 days of receipt of the Notice, You may start an arbitration with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). You may contact the AAA and obtain a free copy of the rules and forms necessary to start an arbitration proceeding at www.adr.org or 1-800-778-7879. ID8 will reimburse You for a filing fee paid to the AAA, and if You are unable to pay a filing fee, ID8 will pay it if You send a written request by certified mail to the Legal Department.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5 pl4">C. The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("Rules") in effect at the time the arbitration is started and as modified by this ARB. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this ARB and shall decide all issues, with the exception that issues relating to the enforceability of this ARB may be decided by a court. If Your dispute is for $10,000 or less, You may conduct the arbitration by submitting documents to the arbitrator or by telephone. If Your dispute is for more than $10,000, Your right to hearings will be determined by the Rules. Unless otherwise agreed, any hearings will take place in the county/parish of Your mailing address. ID8 will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration, unless Your dispute is found by the arbitrator to have been frivolous or brought for an improper purpose under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). In that case, the Rules govern payment of such fees.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5 pl4">D. The arbitrator shall issue a decision including the facts and law upon which his/her decision is based. If the arbitrator finds in Your favor and issues a damages award that is greater than the value of the last settlement offer made by ID8 or if ID8 made no settlement offer, and the arbitrator awards You any damages, ID8 will: (1) pay You the amount of the award or $2,500, whichever is greater; and (2) pay Your attorney, if any, the attorney's fees and expenses reasonably incurred in the arbitration. While the right to the attorney’s fees and expenses discussed above is in addition to any right You may have under applicable law, neither You nor Your attorney may recover duplicate awards of attorney’s fees and expenses. ID8 hereby waives any right it may have under applicable law to recover attorney’s fees and expenses from You if it prevails in the arbitration.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5 pl4">If You seek declaratory or injunctive relief, that relief can be awarded only to the extent necessary to provide You relief. YOU AND ID8 AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Unless You and ID8 agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate Your dispute with the dispute of any other person and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision of this ARB is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this ARB is null and void.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">10.	<strong>CLAIM LIMITATION</strong>.   Unless otherwise allowed by applicable law, any claim related to the Services shall be brought within one year of the events giving rise to the claim. Failure to assert any such claim during that one-year period results in the claim being forever waived and barred.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">11.	<strong>THIRD-PARTIES</strong>.   The Services may expose You to content, websites, products and services created or provided by parties other than ID8 ("third-party content"). ID8 does not review, endorse or assume any responsibility for third-party content and shall have no liability to You for access to or use of third-party content. You access or use third-party content at Your own risk and discretion, and You understand that this Agreement and Privacy Policy do not apply to that third-party content. We may share your information with its authorized third parties in order to provide the Services.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">12.	<strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong>.  You agree that all copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property or proprietary rights associated with the Services are the exclusive property of ID8, and all such rights not expressly granted to You in this Agreement are hereby reserved and retained by ID8. If You submit comments or ideas about the Services, including ways to improve the Services or other products or services ("Ideas"), You agree that Your submission is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction. It does not place ID8 under any fiduciary or other obligation, and ID8 is free to use the Idea without compensation to You and/or to disclose the Idea to anyone on a non-confidential basis. You further acknowledge that ID8 does not, by acceptance of Your submission, waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to ID8, or developed by its employees or obtained from sources other than You.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">13.	<strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong>.  You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ID8 from any claim, proceeding, loss, damage, liability or expense of any kind arising out of or in connection with the following: (a) Your use or misuse of the Services; (b) Your alleged or actual breach of this Agreement; (c) Your alleged or actual violation of any applicable rule, law or regulation; (d) Your negligence or willful misconduct; or (e) Your alleged or actual violation of the intellectual property or other rights of third parties. ID8 reserves the right, at Your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which You are required to indemnify, and You agree to cooperate in that defense.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">14.	<strong>ASSIGNMENT</strong>.  This Agreement and any rights or licenses granted hereunder may not be transferred or assigned by You, but may be transferred or assigned by ID8, without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation of this provision is null and void.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">15.	<strong>SEVERABILITY & WAIVER</strong>.  If any term of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that term should be modified to the extent possible to make it valid or enforceable without losing its intent and purpose. If no such modification is possible, the term should be severed from this Agreement. Any failure to enforce a right or term of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of that right or term.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">16.	<strong>TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF THE SERVICES</strong>.  We reserve the right to suspend or terminate Your use of the Services at any time and for any reason, including for abuse, excessive usage or failure to pay any fees or charges. We also reserve the right to change the scope or extent of the Services at any time and for any reason. Your continued use of the Services shall constitute Your agreement to any updates in the terms of the Services and/or this Agreement.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">17.	<strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT & GOVERNING LAW</strong>.  This Agreement and the documents incorporated by reference constitute our entire agreement with respect to the Services and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements. This Agreement and Your relationship with ID8 shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">18.	<strong>COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS & TECHNICAL PROBLEMS</strong>.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide You with the Services. This means that if We are unable to resolve the issue related to Your Device after making commercially reasonable efforts, We have the right and sole discretion to refuse to take further efforts to resolve the issue related to Your Device. Additionally, in some instances, We may have limited information from vendors, manufacturers, and developers, and We may not have the ability to obtain the proprietary or other information required to resolve the issue related to Your Device. Some technical problems that You encounter when using Your Device may be the result of software or hardware errors not yet resolved by the hardware or software vendors, manufacturers or developers, in which case We may not be able to resolve Your specific issue. In these circumstances, You are still liable to Us for any fees or charges associated with the Services.</p>
  <p class="lh-copy f5">19.	<strong>REPRESENTATIONS & AUTHORIZATIONS</strong>.  When seeking service, You represent to Us that You are the owner and/or the authorized user of the Device at issue, as well as any software on the Device and any device connected to the Device. We reserve the right to refuse to provide You with service if We determine that You are not the owner and/or the authorized user of the Device, software or device. When seeking service, You (a) expressly consent to technical support personnel remotely accessing Your Device and the data thereon through use of software or other means, and (b) authorize Us to effect changes to Your Device, software or device, to the extent necessary to provide the Services and acknowledge and agree that such changes may be permanent and irreversible.</p>
